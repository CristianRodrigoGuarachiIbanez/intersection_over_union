This work is a implementation of three different algorithmus in order to evaluate the detection performance on LIDAR-Image of a CNN model.
To evaluate this on test data set, some statistical metrics (Precision, Recall, IoU) were implemented, which are commonly used for the analysis of the object detection.
Here, the output data of the prediction on a sensor dataset  (LIDAR images) ist used, which contains the model predictions as well as the ground truth coordinates
